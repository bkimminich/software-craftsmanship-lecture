# What is Clean Code?

> * Can be read and enhanced by a developer other than its original
>   author
> * Has unit and acceptance tests
> * Does one thing well
> * Looks like it was written by someone who cares
> * Never obscures the designerâ€˜s intent
> * Each routine you read turns out to be pretty much what you expected
> * Reads like well written prose
> * Provides a clear and minimal API
> * Elegant & efficient

# Intent

```java
// ...
player1.setmenOCom(1);
player2.setmenOCom(0);
// ...
```

:bat: _Can you figure out what these functions are supposed to do?_

# The "Batman Mode" metaphor (:bat:)

When there is a mystery or crime to be solved, Batman will utilize his
brain and all kinds of fancy gadgets to get it done! He will analyze,
investigate and deduce until he has the answer. For him as a
_costumed Super Hero Detective_ it's part of the job!
_Software engineers_ should **never** have to go
into Batman Mode to investigate about names used in the code!

# Clarifying (:interrobang:) declaration

```java
public void setmenOCom(int a) {
  this.menOCom = a;
}
```

---

# Comment (:de:) to the rescue

```java
/**
 * setzt menOCom, 0 = Mensch, 1 = Computer
 *
 * @param int fuer menOCom
 */
public void setmenOCom(int a) {
  this.menOCom = a;
}
```

# Reveal your intent

```
import static PlayerType.*;
// ...
player1.setType(HUMAN);
player2.setType(COMPUTER);
// ...
```

```
public void setType(PlayerType type) {
  this.type = type;
}

public enum PlayerType {
  HUMAN, COMPUTER
}
```
